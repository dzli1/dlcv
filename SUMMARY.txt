DEEP LEARNING ART CLASSIFICATION PROJECT
==========================================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Classifies art by STYLE and ARTIST using deep learning
- Downloads WikiArt dataset from Hugging Face
- Trains 2 multi-task models: ResNet50 + ViT
- Each model predicts both style AND artist simultaneously

MODELS TRAINED:
1. ResNet Multi-task  (style + artist classification)
2. ViT Multi-task     (style + artist classification)

WHY 2 MODELS?
- Multi-task learning is more efficient than separate models
- ResNet and ViT use different architectures (CNN vs Transformer)
- Comparing both shows which works better for art classification

HOW TO RUN:
See RUN_STEPS.txt or run: ./run_full_pipeline.sh

TIME REQUIRED (Single GPU):
- Download data:    30-60 min
- Prepare splits:   5-10 min
- Visualize:        2-5 min
- Train 2 models:   2-5 hours (with GPU)
- Evaluate:         20-40 min
---------------------------------
TOTAL:              ~4-8 hours

WITH 2 GPUs (Parallel Training):
- Use: python train_parallel.py
- Training time cut in HALF: 1-2.5 hours
- TOTAL: ~3-5 hours

WHAT YOU GET:
- Trained models saved in checkpoints/
- Accuracy metrics in reports/comparison_summary.txt
- Confusion matrices for each model
- t-SNE embedding visualizations
- Training curves showing learning progress

RESULTS LOCATION:
cat reports/comparison_summary.txt  # View model accuracies

MAIN BOTTLENECK:
Training the models (2-5 hours with GPU)
- 20 epochs per model
- Each epoch processes entire dataset
- GPU is essential (CPU would take days)
