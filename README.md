Pick a small set of visual categories that each capture one idea

Brushwork, color, light, composition, form, subject, surface

For each category, require a 1 to 2 word descriptor

No nouns, no long phrases

Step 1

Use a vision model to produce those short descriptors per category

Add a simple normalizer

Map synonyms to a shared internal form so “large,” “big,” and “broad” align

Step 2

Feed the normalized descriptors into an LLM to write a short grounded description

Keep subjectivity optional and clearly separated

Observed descriptors first

Interpretive note last
